# RegXGen

Basically, i need a shit ton of test cases to test Matchic Spells. I don't want to do them by hand. This accepts a small set of atomic regex patterns, interprets them, and spits out a random value that fits the pattern. This is not a full blown regex interpreter, nor is it intended to be.
